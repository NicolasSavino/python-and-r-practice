# üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è This program greets you, gets your name and age, and gives a fun fact.

# Print a welcome message
print("Welcome, young wizard-in-training!")
print("What is your name?")  # Ask for their name

# Get the name and store it in a variable
wizardName = input()

# Say hello to the user
print("Greetings, " + wizardName + "! A powerful name indeed.")
print("The number of letters in your name is:")
print(len(wizardName))  # Use len() to find out how long their name is

# Ask for the user's age
print("And now, what is your age?")
wizardAge = input()

# Convert the age string to an integer
wizardAge = int(wizardAge)

# Tell them how old they'll be next year
print("Next year, you shall be " + str(wizardAge + 1) + " years old!")

# Bonus: create a magic chant by repeating their name
print("Here's your magical chant:")
print((wizardName + " the Wise! ") * 3)
